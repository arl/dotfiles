# My dotfiles config...

A simple dotfiles organization following [this excellent tutorial] (http://blog.smalleycreative.com/tutorials/using-git-and-github-to-manage-your-dotfiles/)

`makesymlinks.sh` script comes from 
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaeljsmalley/dotfiles/master/makesymlinks.sh
with the only difference that mine doesn't install zsh

Feel free to use
